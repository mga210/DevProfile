- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All content is contained in a single HTML file with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS media queries for different screen sizes
- **Component-Based Structure**: Modular JavaScript functions for different features (navigation, animations, forms, etc.)

4. **Form Submission**: Contact form validation and submission handling
5. **Mobile Menu**: Toggle events for responsive navigation

## Animation Pipeline
1. **Intersection Observer**: Detects when elements enter viewport
2. **CSS Classes**: JavaScript adds/removes classes to trigger CSS animations
3. **Scroll-based Effects**: Navbar transparency and back-to-top button visibility
